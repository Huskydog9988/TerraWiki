# Introduction

Terra is an incredibly powerful free & open-source world generator written using the Bukkit API. It allows you to
create a world exactly to your specifications, with no knowledge of Java required.

Terra is completely config-defined. This means that Terra doesn't know what a Forest is, or an Ocean, or even what a
cave is! All must be implemented via the advanced config system.

Terra's config system is intuitive and simple to learn, while also being the most powerful config system yet seen in a
world generator. It is not cluttered full of poorly documented, seemingly random values like many other generators' configs are, each value has a purpose, and _makes sense_. This makes Terra not only incredibly powerful, but intuitive and simple to learn at the same time.

## How do I Get Started?

To get started with Terra, take a look at our [[Getting Started]] guide! It will walk you through the basics of
configuration, and provide a simple base config to get started with.

## What if I don't want to configure everything myself?

Simple, use config packs! This repo currently contains Overworld and Nether config packs, ready to be put on your
server with no additional configuration.
